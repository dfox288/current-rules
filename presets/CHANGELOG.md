# Presets changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-03)

- pytest preset: the small tier's write guard allows importlib's atomic bytecode temp file
  (`__pycache__/<name>.pyc.<digits>`) as well as `__pycache__/<name>.pyc`, so a lazy stdlib import in a fresh
  interpreter no longer fails the test. No wider exemption: other names under `__pycache__` and a `.pyc.<digits>`
  name elsewhere are still violations. (horizon-surveyor#76)
